      What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?
    </h3>
    <p>Switch statements take a value of a variable and execute a code section based on the value of the variable.<br>
 Here is an example:<br><br>switch(numberOfFish){
                        <br>    case 1: out.println("There is one fish.");<br>
                                    break;<br>
                            case 2: out.println("There is two fish.");<br>
                                    break;<br>
                            default:out.println("I can't count the fish.");<br>
                                    break;
<br>
                                          }<br><br>
 In the example above if numberOfFish = 1 "There is one fish" prints out, if numberOfFish = 2
 "There is two fish." will print out. All other values will result in " I can't count the fish".



 An if/else statement does a comparison and executes it. However if the condition is not met
 it executes the code within the else portion.
<br>
 Example:<br><br>
            if(number = 1){<br>
                System.out.print("Hello");<br>
            } else {<br>
                System.out.print("Goodbye");<br>
      }<br><br>

In the example above if number = 1 Hello will print out all other values will result in the Goodbye Print out.

if/else is a convenient statement to use when you only have a few values. As the number of values increases switch becomes
more practical. The biggest advantage to using switch statement is the ease of readability and understanding compared to if/else.</p>

    <h3>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</h3>
    <p> '=' is used to initialize variables an example would be "x=2".
 This will initialize x to the value of 2.
 '==' is used as a comparison operation. It represents equals to.
 You would use it whenever you need a comparison. For example number==2.
 This asks if the int number equals 2.
 If it does equal 2 it returns true if it does not it returns false.
 '.equals' is used to compare String objects. It works similar to '=='. Because Strings
 are not primitive date types they can not be compared with '=='.</p>

    <h3>What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h3>
    <p>Void in the method declaration means that the method does not have a return value. Methods that state a type are declaring the data
type of there return value. You can have a variable assignment when a method is called that has a return type.
For example int howManyFish = goneFishing(); . However, you could not do this with a method that has a void return type.</p>

    <h3>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</h3>
    <p>When you import java.util.Scanner you are telling the compiler to recognize Scanner elements as java.util.Scanner. This can save you massive amount of time typing. It also makes your code much easier to read and follow. The 'java' portion is representative of the package structure of java.</p>

    <h3>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</h3><p>Parameters are the variables declared within  a method.
In the example bellow oilType and Temperature are parameters.<br><br>

  fishCooker(String oilType, int Temperature){<br>
    //code here<br>
  };<br><br>

  Arguments are the specific variables used when a method is executed.
  In the example below oilUsed and Temp are the parameters.<br><br>
  String oilUsed = "Olive";<br>
  int Temp = 315;<br><br>

  fishCooker(oilUsed,Temp);</p>
